            <p>All you need to paint is a few tools, a little instruction, and a vision in your mind. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. There comes a nice little fluffer. Every single thing in the world has its own personality - and it is up to you to make friends with the little rascals. And that's when it becomes fun - you don't have to spend your time thinking about what's happening - you just let it happen. If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better.</p>
